              I took my PhD in Business specializing in innovation, digital
              transformation, and the circular economy, with a dissertation on
              how digital technologies enable sustainable and circular business
              models. My doctoral training combined coursework in quantitative
              and qualitative research methods, philosophy of social sciences,
              and innovation studies, alongside electives in AI and digitization
              and advanced statistical techniques. My doctoral thesis, Digital
              Innovations for the Circular Economy (2023), explored how digital
              technologies and innovation processes can enable more sustainable
              and circular business models. The work was evaluated and approved
              by an international committee of scholars from Norway, Denmark,
              and the United Kingdom.

              Master’s degree in Business Administration (Business Innovation)
            </strong>
            <p class="mt-4">
              I earned a Master’s degree in Business Administration (Business
              Innovation) from the University of Stavanger in 2018. The two-year
              program (120 ECTS) provided advanced knowledge of business
              innovation, economics, and applied finance, combining analytical,
              managerial, and research- oriented skills. My coursework covered
              topics such as econometrics, microeconomics, business cycle
              analysis, innovation management, economics of innovation, and
              financial statement analysis. The program emphasized both
              theoretical and applied approaches, including an applied learning
              experience project. My master’s thesis, Innovation Drivers at the
              Firm Level: An Empirical Study of the Norwegian Seafood Industry,
              explored how firms in the seafood sector adopt and drive
              innovation, contributing to insights into industry-specific
              innovation dynamics. This degree equipped me with strong skills in
              economic analysis, innovation management, and applied research,
              preparing me for both academic research and professional roles in
              business and management.
