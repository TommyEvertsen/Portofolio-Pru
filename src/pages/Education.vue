            During my undergraduate studies in Saigon, Vietnam, I developed a
            strong foundation in business principles, marketing, and management.
            My time at Ho Chi Minh City University allowed me to gain practical
            experience and cultural insights that have shaped my approach to
            business and research

          <p>
            At the University of Stavanger in Norway, I specialized in
            innovation studies. My masterâ€™s program deepened my understanding of
            sustainable business models and the role of innovation in driving
            economic growth. This experience also introduced me to international
            perspectives and collaborative research.

            My doctoral research at Nord University focused on circular economy,
            innovation, and entrepreneurship. I explored strategies for resource
            efficiency and sustainable development, contributing to academic
            knowledge and practical solutions for a more resilient future. My
            PhD journey has been driven by curiosity, collaboration, and a
            passion for impactful research.
